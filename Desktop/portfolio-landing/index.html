            <h3>
                <li>This site is for a cupcake store that breaks away from the traditional flavors and introduces exotic
                    dishes in cupcake form. Using HTML, CSS, and class languages we created a colorful,
                    attention-grabbing site that's sure to peak any adventurous eater's interests.

            <h3>
                <li>This site is for an animal shelter that rescues primarily dogs. We higlight unique aspects about
                    each canine and try to find the best match for their <em>furever</em> home. This site uses HTML,
                    CSS, and class to produce colorful columns that make each dog stand out and each potential adopter
                    want to take them all home.

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <div>
        <p>Hey there, my name is John Handley Williams III but you can just call me <strong>Jack</strong>. I'm a 31
            year-old Portland local who recently moved outside the city for the first time since college. After high
            school I attended University of Victoria in British Coloumbia, Canada. Although I had a great experience
            there I decided to postpone my higher education for a couple years until I was more prepared. A couple years
            of being a pharmacy technician went by and I figured it was time to finish my degree so I enrolled in
            Portland Community College and then eventually transitioned to Portland State University where I earned a
            Bachelors of Science degree in Community Development. Now I'm currently residing in Oregon City with my
            girlfriend and our 3 dogs. It has been a fun and interesting adjustment from living on my own for the last
            decade or so. For the last 5+ years I've worked in the food industry, predomininantly as a cook, which I
            mostly enjoyed. There seems to come a time in the service industry grind where you want something different
            and for me that time had come. I learned about coding schools and programs through other people who made the
            switch from the service industry and Epicodus was the one that stood out. I appreciate the fact that it's
            in-person because I find that is how I learn best.</p>
